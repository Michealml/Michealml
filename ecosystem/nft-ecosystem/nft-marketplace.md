# NFT Marketplace

The Helix NFT marketplace is a decentralized exchange where users can buy and sell NFT Heroes.

In order to provide the best experience and the least fees, we have optimized the smart contracts specifically for Battle Field in the following ways.

1. Helix can be exchanged directly within the smart contract.  Therefore users do not have to unstake their NFT Heroes for them to be traded in the NFT Marketplace.  This also minimizes gas fees to provide a low cost experience when trading NFT assets.
2. When a user lists their NFT Heroes for sale, the Heroes hash rate is substracted from the user's Total Hash Rate. Therefore the user does not have to unstake, saving on gas fees.
3. When a user purchases a NFT Hero from the marketplace, the Hero hash rate is added to the user's Total Hash Rate. Therefore the user does not have to stake, saving on gas fees.
4. The marketplace also has a Bundle System giving users the the option to sell or buy multiple NFT Heroes at a time.
5. The Helix platform takes a %% exchange fee that goes to the Buyback and Burn pool. [Learn More](../../token-math/bayback-burn.md)
