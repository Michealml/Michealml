## Old Games

Online entertainment is an extremely competitive industry, with monopolistic companies competing for your information, attention, and money. Several of these companies have adopted gamification techniques to retain users and keep them interested. This is done in many ways, whether it is accumulating more points by running the extra mile on NIKE Plus or gaining levels on your favorite shopping app to chase the next big coupon & bonus points. Using all these systems, apps and features are designed to increase retention and keep you curious for what's to come.‌

Yet with all the time and money spent by the user, the rewards are simply not enough creating an imbalance. Where the company always has the upper hand and extracts every single dollar they possibly can from the user, which leaves them with next to nothing. In 2020 players spent just under $87 billion USD on games, with the very same users receiving a shocking $0 in return. Here’s where MOBOX comes in to make a change.‌
